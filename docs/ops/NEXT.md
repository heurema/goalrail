# Goalrail Next

> Only the next bounded slices. Keep this file short.

## Active phase

- **Phase 0 -> Phase 1 transition**
- product and deployment canon is now in place
- repo overlay structure now keeps Goalrail artifacts in `.goalrail/` and Punk publishing artifacts in `.punk/`
- `apps/web/` now exists as the shared namespace for frontend resources
- `apps/web/console` now exists as the empty real console shell for `console.goalrail.dev`, and `apps/web/console-ru` is its separate Russian copy for `console.goalrail.ru`; future cards and detail views should wait until the CLI/server functionality exists
- `apps/web/demo-change-packet` is the current EN change-packet demo prototype; `apps/web/demo-change-packet-ru` is a separate RU copy for a separate domain; future web work should follow `apps/web/<resource>`
- the next slices should use those overlay boundaries instead of adding ad hoc top-level storage

## Next bounded slices

### Slice 1 — CTO deck outline
Goal:
- create a 6–8 slide outline for CTO / Head of Engineering conversations

Done means:
- problem, product, operating model, deployment, pilot, outputs, and next step are sequenced clearly
- the outline is derived from the current canon rather than ad hoc pitch copy

### Slice 2 — Landing copy rewrite
Goal:
- rewrite `docs/product/GOALRAIL_LANDING_COPY.md` for pilot-first, contract-centered motion

Done means:
- prompt-export framing is removed
- CTA is aligned to pilot qualification / task review
- public flow matches `GOALRAIL_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` and `GOALRAIL_GTM_MODEL.md`

### Slice 3 — Spine package bootstrap
Goal:
- create first implementation package for core domain types and events

Done means:
- IDs, enums, object skeletons, and event envelope compile
- basic serialization / validation tests exist
- implementation starts from the updated canon rather than the older docs baseline

### Slice 4 — Open-source asset provenance audit
Goal:
- classify reference screens, mascot/brand assets, and any third-party materials before broader public OSS reuse

Done means:
- `docs/reference/design/reference_screens/` usage and licensing status are documented
- any exclusions or attribution needs are explicit
- repo-level OSS policy stays aligned with actual asset rights

### Slice 5 — RU demo domain wiring
Goal:
- wire the separate RU demo workspace into the external deployment/infra domain setup

Done means:
- EN and RU demos deploy from separate app paths
- each demo has its own independent domain
- deployment docs or infra receipts state which domain points to which workspace

## Deferred until later

- hosted execution
- tracker integrations
- multi-runtime advisory implementation
- external checks implementation
- analytics / console product features
- Goalrail-specific web product features beyond the current change-packet demo prototypes
